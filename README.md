# **KPMG Marketing Analysis Project**

This project forms part of the KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Internship hosted by Forage.

The internship is structured to simulate a genuine consulting project, providing an invaluable opportunity to immerse oneself in the inner workings of a consulting firm. Participants gain hands-on experience in tasks such as data collection, data capture, data analysis, and deriving meaningful insights to present to clients.

**Project Overview:**
The primary task involved a comprehensive analysis of the client's data. This encompassed data cleansing, manipulation, and visualization, all of which were executed using various tools, including Python. By undertaking this process, I was able to unearth crucial trends and insights that ultimately informed recommendations to the client.

**Project Modules:**

1. **Data Quality Assessment:** I conducted a thorough assessment of data quality to ensure its accuracy and completeness. This step included checks for data completeness, deduplication, and data accuracy validation.

2. **Data Insights:** Using Jupyter Notebook in Python, I delved into statistical analyses, exploring correlations between variables. I also employed techniques such as creating pivot tables and charts to visually represent the data and highlight trends.

3. **Data Insights and Presentation:** This phase involved harnessing Power BI to construct interactive dashboards that presented data in an engaging and comprehensible manner.

**Skills Acquired:**

- Data Analysis (utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook)
- Customer Segmentation (conducted RFM Analysis)
- Data Dashboard Creation (utilizing Power BI to design interactive and high-quality dashboards)

This internship provided an enriching learning experience, equipping me with the ability to interpret and analyze data effectively to uncover key insights. Additionally, I developed proficiency in presenting these findings in a concise and understandable manner, ensuring that clients can grasp the implications of the data-driven insights.
